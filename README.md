# Abstract
Based on the pan-cancer DNA methylation 450K microarray data, the non-parametric test method and classical feature extraction method (NMF) were used to extract conserved methylation signature in tumors for the mega-matrix, and to elucidate the process of specific methylation signatures generation and its application to clinical guidance
